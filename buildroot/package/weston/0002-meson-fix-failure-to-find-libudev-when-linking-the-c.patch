Subject: [PATCH 2/5] meson: fix failure to find libudev when linking the
 compositor

The compositor links against libinput, which in turn is linked against
libudev. When the compositor is linked, it has a dependency on libinput,
but not libudev. Whilst this is correct, it means the linker won't be
able to find libudev if the library is in a non-standard place (i.e.
a place where the linker wouldn't normally look).

Workaround the problem by adding libudev as a dependency for the
compositor.
