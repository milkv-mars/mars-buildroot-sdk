Subject: [PATCH 5/5] backend-drm: allow linear framebuffers if no KMS modifier
 support

If KMS doesn't support modifiers, but a framebuffer is supplied via
a dmabuf with a linear modifier, assume the buffer is compatible with
KMS. This scenario can occur when different drivers are used for the
GPU and KMS, and the GPU driver supports modifiers.

Some platforms used internally by IMG, such as the Acer R13 Chromebook,
have KMS drivers that don't support modifiers. Without this change,
applications such as weston-simple-egl cannot keep up with vsync.
This problem didn't occur with older versions of Weston (e.g, 9.0.0).

This change can be dropped for platforms where KMS supports modifiers.

The change that prompted this one was:

    backend-drm: add DRM_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID to modifier sets when no
